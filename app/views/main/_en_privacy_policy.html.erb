Privacy policy
Last updated: May 2022 
Giocaneers respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. Below we would like to inform you about the nature, scope, and purposes of the collection and use of your personal data on our website and any other digital products, including any desktop or smartphone application. In the following, the said website, products, and applications are collectively referred to as the "Platform". 
We generally treat personal data as confidential in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the law. We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. When you use our Platform, various personal data are collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. 
This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done. Data transmission on the Internet can have security gaps, for example, in the e-mail communication. We would like to point out that complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
What data do we collect and how and why do we process your data?
When you visit this website or use our app, certain device-related data is automatically collected and processed. In addition, certain data is requested from you (e.g. e-mail address) and collected by input. These are the so-called server log files that typically occur when visiting a website. 
As a rule, the following data is transmitted to us:
Technical data (include: Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, your login information, your Internet connection, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and information about the device (computer or mobile device) you use to access our platform).
Transaction Data (includes: Details about transactions with you and other details of services you have purchased from us)
Profile Data (includes: Tournament points (including by round) and placements, army lists, and table assignments
Usage data (includes: information about how you use our platform)
Marketing and Communications Data (includes: Your preferences regarding marketing you receive from us and third-party vendors and your communication preferences)
Identity Data (includes: first name and last name)
Contact Data (includes: email address)
Address data (converted to GPS data using Open Street Map).
Some of the data is collected to ensure error-free provision of the website. Other data may be used to analyze user behavior.
To ensure the functionality of the website logins, this service uses session cookies. Session cookies are used by us to verify logins.
The use of this website without processing this data is technically not possible.
The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO.
Open Street Map(OpenStreetMap Foundation, 132 Maney Hill Road, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands B72 1JU, United Kingdom) is integrated into the platform so that we can display the geographical location of the venues of scheduled matches and tournaments. This results in anonymous requests to Open Street's server with the respective addresses. This is an essential part of our service and the data transfer thus takes place in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit.f DSGVO on the basis of legitimate interests. Further information about Open Street Map can be found at https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy.
If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data becomes necessary, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO.
Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing operations of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a EU Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO) serves as the legal basis.
Is data passed on?
The provision of the website usually requires the involvement of instruction-dependent processors, such as data center operators. External service providers who process data on our behalf are carefully selected by us and strictly bound by a contract. The service providers work according to our instructions, which is ensured by strict contractual regulations, technical and organizational measures, and supplementary controls. Otherwise, your data will only be transferred if you have given us your express consent to do so or on the basis of legal regulation.
A transfer to third countries outside the EU/EEA or to an international organization does not take place unless there are adequate guarantees. These include the EU standard contractual clauses and an adequacy decision by the EU Commission.
If the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the former interest, Article 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO serves as the legal basis for the processing.
Can other users locate you based on your location information?
Location information is only displayed to other users in approximate relation to the respective user without consent. This means that unauthorized persons cannot determine your location by comparing it with the distances of other users. You consent to the transfer of your address information to other users by agreeing to their requests to participate in a game or tournament, or whose game or tournament you join upon invitation.
